                    Travelling still remains slightly uncertain even in 2022, therefore, our key priority is to provide <strong>more booking flexibility</strong> to our hesitating customers. Why deprive yourself of your dream holidays in 2022, when you know <strong>you can rearrange in case you are unable to travel</strong> due to Covid-19 related restrictions*?
                </p>  <br>

                <p>
                 In order to increase the consumer confidence, we at My Croatia Cruise offer <strong>free cruise reschedule**</strong> within 24 months if your travel is affected by Covid-19 related restrictions.
                </p>

                <p>
                *With Covid-19 related restrictions, one of the following must apply:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you test positive for COVID-19 within 30 days before the departure date and can provide medical evidence (certificate/statement) to support this.</li>
                    <li>If government policies of the destination country prevent you from entering due to their restrictions on your country of residence.</li>
                    <li>If government policies of the country of your residence force holiday cancellation and prevent you from travelling due to their guidelines and restrictions. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Should you prefer to cancel completely due to the reasons mentioned above, most of our cruises are 90% refundable up to 30 days before the departure date. ***
<br>** Rescheduling is subject to availability.
